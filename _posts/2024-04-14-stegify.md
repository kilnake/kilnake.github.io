Stegify is a command line tool which performs steganography encoding and is implemented in Golang.

The tool is capable of hiding any kind of file in any image or set of images. This encoding is 100% clueless and transparent for the eye.

In short the file is hidden in the image/s last two bits of each color segment. The technique is known as LSB steganography.
