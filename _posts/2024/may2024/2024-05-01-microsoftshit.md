# Generate powershell GUI directly 

This is fantastic for those who are coming from bash environment like me to get familiar with powershell.

```powershell
Show-Command Get-Process
```
![PowershellGUI](/assets/powershellgui.webp)

> Show-Command <any cmdlet> (e.g. Show-Command Get-Process) will create an UI for any PowerShell command.

## You can increase the FPS limit on RDP from 30hz to 60hz with a simple registry edit on the host machine

To do configure the registry entry, follow these steps:

    Start Registry Editor.
    Go to the following registry subkey:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations
    On the Edit menu, select New, and then select DWORD(32-bit) Value.
    Type DWMFRAMEINTERVAL, and then press Enter.
    Right-click DWMFRAMEINTERVAL, and select Modify.
    Select Decimal, type 15 in the Value data box, and then select OK. This sets the maximum frame rate to 60 FPS.
    Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

Frame rate mapping

    15 decimal = 60 frames
    10 decimal = 40 frames
    5 decimal = 20 frames
    1 decimal = 4 frames

## Reset Windows Graphics Driver

This key combo causes the Desktop Window Manager to recreate its graphics context and surface

>  From a discussion with an AMD Radeon driver engineer, it does NOT restart the graphics driver. It does appear to discard the desktop surface buffer and re-create the allocation from DWM (on a healthy system the desktop goes black for a second)

> Ctrl+Shift+Windows+B

Any time Iâ€™m having issues with my monitors not being detected, screens flashing, etc. this shortcut comes in handy. Can be useful in a myriad of situations. Enjoy!
