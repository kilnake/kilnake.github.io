#### How not to get screwed when buying a used car.

# Before you even see it:

Message the seller with these questions. I ask them one at a time or they will answer some and not others giving the illusion they answered you.

1.  Have you had any major repairs done on it?
2.  Is anything wrong at all on the car?
3.  Will it pass emissions as it stands right now?
4.  When was the last oil change?
5.  Is there any rust on the undercarriage and body?
6.  How many fobs and keys come with it?
7.  Do all the fobs work?

If you like the answers, schedule a test drive **in the daylight**. Request that it not be driven for 2 hours prior so when you arrive you get the cold start. Ask that the fobs be available when you show up so you can test each of them.

# When you arrive:

**NOTE:** Avoid having the seller stand too near to obstruct vision of abnormalities and talk/distract you from the inspection.

1.  Inspect cosmetic condition. Dings, dents, scrapes, windshield cracks and mention your findings out loud if seller is in ear shot.
2.  Check tires for tread.
3.  Check that tires are wearing evenly.
4.  Make sure tires aren't older than 5 years old (google "how to check tire age").
5.  Check the spare tire and ensure it’s inflated.

# Functionality inspection

**NOTE:** Order matters here as you don’t want to run certain things while the car is/isn’t warmed up.

1.  Test all provided fobs.
2.  Before starting it, check the oil level.
3.  Turn the key to acc, see if the check engine light works.
4.  Turn it on. Check the temp gauge. If the car is warmed up, ask when the last time it was driven.
5.  Go to the rear and make sure no smoke come out of the exhaust.
6.  Pop the hood. Get out and listen to engine for any odd noises for about 15 seconds.
7.  Check battery terminals for corrosion.
8.  Check that the engine bay is completely DRY. Look for leaks or wet areas.
9.  Check the transmission fluid dip stick.
10. Check the brake fluid.

11. Inspect the coolant reservoir, which should show if coolant is low.

12. Get under the car and look for **any** leaks and/or rust.

13. Test low beams (headlights)

14. High beams (brights)

15. Blinkers (front and rear)

16. Brake lights

17. Reverse lights

18. License plate lights

19. Engage the parking break.

20. For each door: Open, get in, close it, test that the window rolls all the way up and down. Make sure it has a mat.

21. Open and inspect the hatch/trunk. Examine hydraulics if applicable.

22. Roll all windows down from drivers seat, make sure they’re all down, then roll them all up. Sunroof if applicable.

23. Honk the horn a few times.

24. Run Wipers and spray wiper fluid.

25. Slide the front seats forward and back.

26. Turn the radio on, check the speakers.

27. Test the Heater.

28. Test the AC.

# Test drive

Try and drive without the seller (otherwise you’re either in for them distracting you from issues or an awkward long silence so you can listen to the car). Tell them you’re going to take it to AutoZone (or where ever) and get the codes scanned. Take it to the nearest road/freeway that you can go 60+ MPH.

1.  Engage reverse and make sure it works.
2.  Ensure **each** gauge on the cluster works.
3.  Engage the 4WD if applicable. Disengage before proceeding.
4.  Do a U turn, make sure power steering works. It should be silent and easy to turn the steering wheel.
5.  Test the brakes. They should be responsive with no squeaking and definitely no grinding.
6.  Use cruise control for at least 30 seconds.
7.  Accelerate quickly, it should shift smoothly if it’s automatic.
8.  Take it above 60 MPH for around 8 miles. There should be no odd noises or wobbles, and it shouldn’t pull one direction or the other.
9.  Take it to an AutoZone, get the codes scanned. Tell them you're on a test drive and they can help you interpret the results.

# Preparing to make an offer

1.  Buy the carfax. More than 3 owners: not great. If they bought it recently: usually a red flag. Check for recent repairs that weren’t acknowledged. If there are gaps in service records, ask why. It could mean they didn’t do any maintenance during that time.
2.  Acknowledge all the abnormalities you found. Consider calling the most expensive shop around and getting a quote for the repairs.

# If you still want to make the offer:

1.  Bring up every abnormality you found to the seller and work that into your offer (even if you know you’re not going to get the repairs done). You probably will have found at least one.
2.  While the seller has the issues on top of mind, make your offer.

Why YSK: So you save yourself money and headache.
