# Generate powershell GUI directly 

This is fantastic for those who are coming from bash environment like me to get familiar with powershell.

```powershell
Show-Command Get-Process
```
![PowershellGUI](/assets/powershellgui.webp)

> Show-Command <any cmdlet> (e.g. Show-Command Get-Process) will create an UI for any PowerShell command.
{: .prompt-tip }

## This module shows user a toast message that their windows is on for long time and requries a hard-restart

## Reset Windows Graphics Driver

This key combo causes the Desktop Window Manager to recreate its graphics context and surface

>  From a discussion with an AMD Radeon driver engineer, it does NOT restart the graphics driver. It does appear to discard the desktop surface buffer and re-create the allocation from DWM (on a healthy system the desktop goes black for a second)

> Ctrl+Shift+Windows+B
{: .prompt-tip }

Any time Iâ€™m having issues with my monitors not being detected, screens flashing, etc. this shortcut comes in handy. Can be useful in a myriad of situations. Enjoy!
