Today we will install nginx for our local web server to host all over media hosted on our NAS/local-drive and to view it on kodi on any device **ANY DEVICE**. If you have a browser you can see all the NAS content or if you want cheeky artwork like you see on netflix then just install kodi on any device.

Mobile

WebOS

Firestick

or whatever that runs kodi.

## My setup

I have proxmox so i created Alpine linux with docker compose container with few containers within it.

> But you can have any machine with docker compose installed.
{: .prompt-info }

## Create folder

I have named it nginxformedia or you can name it anything.

Note down your local ip address for kodi or just viewing the files from our NAS or local drive and then go into folder

```bash
ip a
mkdir mginxformedia
cd nginxformedia
```

## Create docker compose file

Copy yaml provided:

* Here we will install nginx to show all files in our local network.
* Filebrowser to easily navigate and make and edit files as Alpine-linux is CLI only.
* Transmission our lovely torrent downloader for downloading everything.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  nginx:
    container_name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "9999:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginxformedia:/config
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - /data/media:/data/media:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
  filebrowser:
    container_name: filebrowser
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Stockholm
    volumes:
      - ./filebrowser:/config
      - /:/srv
  transmission:
    container_name: transmission
    image: linuxserver/transmission:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 9091:9091
      - 51413:51413
      - 51413:51413/udp
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Stockholm
    volumes:
      - ./transmission:/config
      - /data/media:/data/torrents:rw
```
Now make another file in the same folder where you will save docker-compose.yaml file and name it nginx.conf.

## Nginx.conf

```
events {}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name localhost;

        root /data/media;
       # index index.html index.htm;

        location / {
            autoindex on;
        }
    }
}
```
> Now you can see all the data is on /data/media and is connected to your torrent client.
{: .prompt-info }
