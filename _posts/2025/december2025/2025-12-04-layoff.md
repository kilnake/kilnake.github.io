# Signs of your company is preparing for layoffs 


> This post got long, so I’ve broken it down by timeline and severity. Hopefully this helps someone see what’s coming and prepare accordingly.

## EARLY WARNING SIGNS (3-6 months out)

**Financial and strategic shifts:**

Hiring freeze gets announced, especially if it’s sudden or poorly explained. When companies say *“we’re being strategic about growth”* out of nowhere, that’s HR-speak for *“we’re about to cut costs aggressively.”* Pay attention to whether it’s a soft freeze (critical roles only) or hard freeze (literally nobody).

Executives start talking about *“efficiency,” “operational excellence,” “doing more with less,” or “rightsizing”* in all-hands meetings. Once leadership starts using these phrases repeatedly, start paying attention. They’re preparing employees psychologically for cuts.

The company misses earnings or revenue targets multiple quarters in a row, or leadership keeps revising guidance downward. Public companies especially - check their investor relations page and quarterly calls.

Consultants show up. Specifically McKcKinsey, Bain, Deloitte, or similar firms. They’re not there to make things better for employees - they’re there to identify *“redundancies”* and provide cover for cuts leadership already wants to make. If you see consultants doing org chart analysis or *“efficiency studies,”* that’s a massive red flag.

Leadership changes at the top. New CEO, CFO, or COO often means new priorities. New executives frequently want to *“make their mark”* within the first 100 days, and layoffs are a quick way to cut costs and restructure.

**Budget and resource signals:**

Training and development budgets disappear. Conference approvals get denied, software licenses don’t get renewed, that certification you wanted gets tabled indefinitely. When companies stop investing in employee development, they’re not planning long-term with current staff.

Discretionary spending freezes. Team outings canceled, holiday parties scaled back or eliminated, small perks disappear. These are the easiest costs to cut first.

Delayed or frozen merit increases and bonuses. If annual raises get *“postponed”* or bonuses are cut despite decent performance, the company is hoarding cash for something.

Open headcount gets quietly closed. You might not notice a hiring freeze officially, but those three open roles on your team just stop being discussed.

**Cultural and messaging changes:**

The *“we’re a family”* messaging intensifies. Ironically, when companies start really pushing the culture stuff hard, it’s often because morale is tanking and they know what’s coming. Authentic culture doesn’t need constant reinforcement.

Town halls become more frequent but less substantive. Leadership is trying to control the narrative and keep people calm, but they’re not actually saying anything meaningful.

Internal communications shift tone. Messages become more formal, more carefully worded, more legal-sounding. This usually means lawyers are reviewing everything.

**Real estate and facilities:**

Office consolidation starts being discussed. Subleasing space, breaking leases early, or suddenly pushing hybrid/remote work after being office-focused. Real estate is expensive and often the first place companies look to cut.

Facilities staff reductions. If maintenance, security, or reception teams shrink, that’s a leading indicator.

## MEDIUM-TERM SIGNS (1-3 months out)

**The ones people miss:**

Your manager starts acting weird in 1-on-1s. They seem distant, can’t give you clear answers about future projects, or suddenly don’t want to talk about your career development, or they cancel 1-on1s. They often know 4-6 weeks before you do and are terrible at hiding it. Watch for:

   - Avoiding eye contact

   - Being vague about Q2/Q3 planning

   - Not fighting for resources they normally would

   - Seeming stressed or checked out

Cross-functional projects get canceled or put on hold indefinitely. If that big initiative involving multiple teams suddenly loses steam, it’s often because leadership knows the teams won’t exist soon.

Reorganizations that don’t make sense. When they shuffle reporting structures or combine teams in weird ways, they’re often preparing for consolidation. The reorg is the setup; the layoff is the follow-through.

Senior people start leaving and aren’t replaced. When your VP quietly exits and the role just disappears or gets absorbed, that’s a restructure preview. Execs often see the writing on the wall before layoffs and jump ship.

The “high performer” narrative shifts. Suddenly everyone’s being evaluated more critically, PIPs increase, and the bar for “meeting expectations” gets higher. They’re building paper trails.

**HR and administrative signals:**

HR schedules random meetings with employees to *“check in.”* This can be them gauging morale, but it can also be them identifying who might be problems during layoffs (ie, who might sue or cause issues).

Increased focus on documentation. HR suddenly cares a lot about having everything in writing, attendance records are scrutinized, minor policy violations are documented. They’re building files.

Anonymous surveys about *“organizational effectiveness” or “role clarity.”* They’re identifying redundancies and overlapping responsibilities.

**Operational changes:**

Vendors get cut or renegotiated aggressively. If the company is trying to save money everywhere, labor costs are next.

Projects shift from innovation to maintenance. All the exciting new work stops, and teams are just keeping lights on. This suggests they don’t believe in long-term investment right now.

Contractors and temps disappear first. This is always the canary in the coal mine. If contractors are let go en masse, full-time employees are usually 4-8 weeks behind.

**Financial desperation moves:**

The company takes on debt or seeks additional funding under unfavorable terms. This suggests cash flow problems.

Asset sales. Selling off business units, real estate, IP, or other assets to raise cash.

Delayed payments to vendors. If your company is stretching payables or late on bills, they’re struggling with cash.

## IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS (2-4 weeks out)

> The “oh shit” tier:
{: .prompt-warning }

You or your team suddenly gets asked to document all your processes in detail, create runbooks, or do knowledge transfers “for continuity.” They’re preparing for people to be gone and don’t want institutional knowledge walking out the door.

Managers have mysterious meetings that aren’t on the calendar, or meetings that say *“leadership sync”* with no agenda. Often they’re being told how to “rank” their teams (stack ranking) or getting trained on how to deliver termination news.

> HR blocks calendar time that’s marked private across the entire organization on the same day. That’s layoff day. Usually a Wednesday or Thursday.
{: .prompt-danger }

Managers seem panicked or are suddenly unavailable. They’re either in planning meetings or mentally preparing for what they have to do.

IT or Security starts asking random questions about access, or you notice permissions audits. They’re preparing to revoke access quickly.

Conference rooms get blocked all day with “private” meetings. Those are the termination meetings.

The parking lot has way more cars than usual early in the morning on a random day. Leadership arrives early to prepare and coordinate.

**The final 48 hours:**

Executives all happen to be *“in the office”* on the same day when they’re usually remote or traveling. They want to show their faces and deliver messages in person.

Your manager asks for a *“quick sync”* with no context, or you get a calendar invite for early morning with just *“meeting.”* That’s often the termination conversation.

You notice coworkers disappearing into conference rooms and not coming back, or leaving with boxes. If it’s happening, it’s happening to multiple people today.

Email access starts acting weird, VPN connections drop, or badge access to certain areas stops working. IT is already starting to shut you down.

> WHAT TO DO - ACTION PLAN
{: .prompt-tip }

### Preparation phase (as soon as you see early signs)

- Update LinkedIn immediately. Make sure your profile is complete and compelling. Turn on “open to work” privately so recruiters can see it but your company can’t.

- Refresh your resume and tailor it for your target roles. Have multiple versions ready for different job types. Get it reviewed by someone who knows your industry.

- Document your accomplishments with metrics. Revenue generated, costs saved, projects delivered, teams built. Save this somewhere personal, not company equipment.

- Save important files legally. Performance reviews, reference letters, samples of your work (that aren’t confidential), documentation of your achievements. Email them to your personal account or save to personal cloud storage. Do NOT take confidential company information, client data, or proprietary code.

- Screenshot or save your LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements. Sometimes people leave and delete their profiles.

- Reconnect with your network NOW while you’re employed. It’s easier to get coffee as a “catch up” than as a desperate job seeker. Reach out to old colleagues, mentors, recruiters you’ve worked with.

### Financial preparation:

- Build emergency fund if possible. Even an extra month of expenses helps.

- Understand your benefits. Know your PTO balance, how severance works at your company (if there’s a standard package), what COBRA costs, when your stock vests, and what happens to your 401k.

- Reduce expenses where you can. Not to panic level, but maybe hold off on big purchases.

- Check if you have any loans against 401k or obligations tied to employment. Some companies require repayment upon termination.

### Legal and administrative:

- Keep records of everything. If you suspect you’re being targeted unfairly (discrimination, retaliation), document it meticulously with dates and witnesses.

- Check your employment contract for non-compete, non-solicitation, and IP assignment clauses. Know what you signed.

### Mental preparation:

- This is not about your worth. Layoffs are business decisions, usually driven by executive mistakes or market conditions. Even top performers get cut.

- Have a plan for how you’ll spend day one after a layoff. Whether it’s updating your resume, going for a run, or calling a friend, having a plan helps you not spiral.

- Tell your partner or trusted person what might be coming. Don’t suffer alone or let it blindside your household.

**If/when it happens:**

- Don’t sign anything immediately. You usually have time to review severance agreements. Consider having an employment lawyer review it, especially if it includes non-compete or release clauses.

- Negotiate if possible. Severance, extended healthcare, references, job search support, equity vesting. The worst they can say is no, and many companies have wiggle room.

- File for unemployment immediately. Even if you get severance, you might be eligible. Don’t leave money on the table.

- Ask for a neutral reference or letter of recommendation before you leave. Much easier to get this on day one than six months later.

- Understand what’s happening to your benefits. COBRA deadlines, life insurance conversion options, FSA/HSA balances.

- Get contact info for colleagues you want to stay in touch with. Once you lose email access, it’s hard to reconnect.

**Job search strategy:**

- Take a day or two to process emotionally. You don’t have to start applying immediately.

- Quality over quantity. Targeted applications with customized materials beat spray-and-pray.

- Use your network first. Most jobs are filled through referrals. Let people know you’re looking.

- Consider contract or freelance work to bridge gaps. It keeps money coming in and shows you stayed active.

- Be honest in interviews about the layoff. “Company went through restructuring” or “position was eliminated due to budget cuts” is fine. Most interviewers get it, especially if layoffs were public.

> **WHAT NOT TO DO**
{: .prompt-tip }

- Don’t panic or make it obvious you’re job hunting. Don’t print your resume on the company printer, don’t take recruiting calls at your desk, don’t update LinkedIn with “OPEN TO WORK” publicly while still employed.

- Don’t badmouth the company publicly. Even if you’re furious, keep it professional. The industry is smaller than you think.

- Don’t stop doing your job. Keep performing until the end. You want good references and you never know what might change.

- Don’t burn bridges with your manager. Even if they’re delivering bad news, they’re probably just doing what they were told. Stay professional.

- Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Seriously, don’t steal company property, access data you shouldn’t, or do anything that could give them cause for termination instead of layoff. You want that severance and unemployment eligibility.

**AFTERMATH - IF YOU SURVIVE THE CUT**

- Survivor’s guilt is real. It’s okay to feel relieved and also sad for colleagues who were let go.

- Your workload is about to increase dramatically. Set boundaries early and document what’s not getting done. Don’t try to do three people’s jobs.

- Start looking anyway. Companies that do one round of layoffs often do more. Plus, the culture and workload might not be sustainable.

- Support your laid-off colleagues. Write recommendations, make introductions, be a reference. What goes around comes around.
