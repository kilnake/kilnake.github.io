4. **Logout**: Find your current Git account and click on the "Logout" button next to it. This will disconnect GitKraken from your current Git account.

5. **Login with New Account**: After logging out, click on the "Login" button and enter the credentials for your new Git account.

6. **Verify Connection**: Once logged in with your new account, verify that GitKraken is now connected to the correct Git account by checking the account details displayed in the Authentication tab.

7. **Restart GitKraken (if necessary)**: In some cases, you may need to restart GitKraken for the changes to take effect fully.
